End-to-End Relational Database Implementation (MySQL · Python · Data Governance)
By: Aron Perczel

⭐ Project Overview

This project is a complete, production-style implementation of a bookstore relational database system, designed to demonstrate practical skills in:

    Database modeling (ERD, normalization)

    SQL schema creation (MySQL)

    Python-based data loading and cleaning

    Stored procedures, triggers & views

    Indexing and performance considerations

    Security & role-based access control

    Data governance & data quality handling

The goal is to showcase real-world database developer and data engineering competence through an end-to-end, fully documented project.

---

## 📐 Data Model

The project includes a complete ER diagram and schema export created using dbdiagram.io.

![ER Diagram](assets/er_diagram.jpg)

The model follows normalized design (3NF), supports multiple genres per book, warehouse-level inventory tracking, and a realistic order management workflow.

---

## 🗄️ MySQL Schema

Includes:
    ✔ Primary & foreign keys
    ✔ Junction tables (books_genres)
    ✔ Composite keys (inventory)
    ✔ Indexing strategy
    ✔ Governance notes on referential integrity & quality

---

## 📊 Sample Data (CSV)

Realistic data for all tables, including well-known authors and book titles, plus intentionally injected data quality issues to demonstrate governance skills.

---

## 🧹 Python Data Loading & Cleaning

Capabilities:
    ✔ Detection of invalid emails
    ✔ Missing value handling
    ✔ Duplicate removal
    ✔ Automatic type correction
    ✔ Safe MySQL loading via pymysql

---

## ⚙️ Stored Procedures

Features:
    ✔ Transaction handling
    ✔ Multi-item orders
    ✔ Error checks

---

## 🔄 Triggers

Features:
    ✔ Backup mechanism
    ✔ Prevents double-deduction
    ✔ Ensures consistency when orders bypass stored procedures

---

## 👁️ Views

`vw_customer_orders` joins customers, orders, and ordered books into a single analytical structure.

---

## 🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Two database users were created following the *principle of least privilege*:

| Role              | Permissions |
|------------------|-------------|
| `readonly_user`  | SELECT only |
| `data_entry_user`| INSERT into orders + order_items |
