This folder contains realistic sample datasets used to populate the Bookstore Database.

Datasets:
- Authors with real-world names
- Books with correct author mapping
- Customers, orders, order items
- Genres, warehouses, inventory levels

Data quality issues (invalid emails, missing fields, duplicates) were intentionally included to demonstrate data cleaning and governance techniques.
